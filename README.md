App to draw random teams to games in a championship

After playing a soccer championship with some friends, some of them were arguing about how they played two matches in a row while some was complaining about being a long time
out of the field just watching and waiting for their time.
So, based on this I tried to make a tool that would draw the teams without making anyone playing two games in a row and where you dont have to wait lots of time until your game.

I used javascript on it and could solve the problem applying some conditionals (ifs) after drawing the teams to a game (verifying if they played the last game, verify if the teams that got draw hadn't played against each other
and verify if there are any possibility to follow the draw without breaking some of the conditions).
